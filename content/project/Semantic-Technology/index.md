This project in which I as involved was for the development of Digital Diagnostic Algorithm that would be used for training junior physicians in the diagnosis of stat cases. I was the lead in the development of the ontological databases. The following were the scope of the disease domains for which, I had developed the ontologies.

The following are the screen shots of the application which was developed. This was primarily for wearables using the palm os
