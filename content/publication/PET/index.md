abstract = "The Emergency Medicine Programme in Ireland recommends a national Total ED Time (TEDT) standard of 95% of patients having their emergency care completed within 6 hours of arrival in an ED. Numerous factors influence our ability to meet Patient Experience Time (PET) targets. Consequent to our pilot study in May 20152, the aim of this study is to determine those factors within the ED that had maximum influence on the ‘6-hour target’ compliance for all patients presenting to the ED over a 24 hour period."
